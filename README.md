# postmodern-git-commit
a postmodern novel written in real time git commits 

I got this idea because I was an English major and I'm learning to code. 

There are so many layers to the git message and it feels like an unappreciated art form. 

This is probably dumb. Is this dumb? Maybe I'm exhausted. I should stop.
